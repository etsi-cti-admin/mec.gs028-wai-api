  // Reporting condition for the Beacon Report as per Table 9-89 of IEEE 802.11-2016 [8]: 0 = Report to be issued after each measurement. 1 = measured RCPI level is greater than the threshold. 2 = measured RCPI level is less than the threshold. 3 = measured RSNI level is greater than the threshold. 4 = measured RSNI level is less than the threshold. 5 = measured RCPI level is greater than a threshold defined by an offset from the serving AP's reference RCPI. 6 = measured RCPI level is less than a threshold defined by an offset from the serving AP's reference RCPI. 7 = measured RSNI level is greater than a threshold defined by an offset from the serving AP's reference RSNI. 8 = measured RSNI level is less than a threshold defined by an offset from the serving AP's reference RSNI. 9 = measured RCPI level is in a range bound by the serving AP's reference RCPI and an offset from the serving AP's reference RCPI. 10 = measured RSNI level is in a range bound by the serving AP's reference RSNI and an offset from the serving AP's reference RSNI.

  // The threshold subfield contains either the threshold value or the offset value to be used for conditional reporting.  For reportingCondition subfield with values 1 and 2, the threshold value is a logarithmic function of the received signal power, as defined in section 9.4.2.38 of IEEE 802.11-2016 [8].  For reportingCondition subfield values 3 and 4, the threshold value is a logarithmic function of the signal-to-noise ratio, as described in section 9.4.2.41 of IEEE 802.11-2016 [8].  For reportingCondition subfield values 5 to 10, the offset value is an 8-bit 2s complement integer in units of 0,5 dBm. The indicated reporting condition applies individually to each measured Beacon, Measurement Pilot, or Probe Response frame.
