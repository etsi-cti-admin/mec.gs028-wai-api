            actual load measurement duration is greater than the maximum value,
            the maximum value will be reported. The value of the LMD field is
            set to 0 when neither the uplink nor downlink load can be computed.
            When the uplink and downlink loads are computed over different
            intervals, the maximum interval is reported.
